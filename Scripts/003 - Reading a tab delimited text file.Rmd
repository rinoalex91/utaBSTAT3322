# R: Reading a tab delimited text file with R

A tab delimited text file is a file where the columns between variable names are separated by the tab character which is denoted by "\t" in R.  If you double click on the data folder in the files directory you will find a file $06-natural_gas.txt$.  Double click on this file and it will be opened in the editor with a new edit window.

## The read.table command

### Dewsctiption
Reads a file in table format and creates a data frame from it, with cases corresponding to lines and variables to fields in the file.

### Useage

read.table(file, header = FALSE, sep = "\t" )

### Example

```{r,readTable}

rm( list=ls())          # Clear envirponment

wd   <-  getwd()                        # Get workining directory
file <- "06_natural_gas.txt"            # Specify file to be read
path <- file.path( wd, "data", file )   # Complete path to file

NaturalGas <- read.table( path,         # Path and file name.
                          header=TRUE,  # File contains a header giving variable names
                          sep="\t" )    # Data is serperated by tabs

head( NaturalGas )                      # Show first 6 rows
tail( NaturalGas )                      # and last 7 rows


```
