If you double click on the data folder in the files directory you will find a file $06-natural_gas.txt$.  Double click on this file and it will be opened in the editor with a new edit window.\n\n## The read.table command\n\n### Dewsctiption\nReads a file in table format and creates a data frame from it, with cases corresponding to lines and variables to fields in the file.\n\n### Useage\n\nread.table(file, header = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\" )\n\n### Example\n\n```{r,readTable}\n\nrm( list=ls())          # Clear envirponment\n\nwd   <-  getwd()                        # Get workining directory\nfile <- \"06_natural_gas.txt\"            # Specify file to be read\npath <- file.path( wd, \"data\", file )   # Complete path to file\n\nNaturalGas <- read.table( path,         # Path and file name.\n                          header=TRUE,  # File contains a header giving variable names\n                          sep=\"\\t\" )    # Data is serperated by tabs\n\nhead( NaturalGas )                      # Show first 6 rows\ntail( NaturalGas )                      # and last 7 rows\n\n\n```\n\n",
